# movie-grp-2

Your project should fulfill the following requirements:

Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.

Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

Use at least two server-side APIs.

Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

Be responsive.

Have a polished UI.

Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

Finally, you must add your project to the portfolio that you created in Module 2.

## Discussion Notes:
Movie Theme
Use of 2 APIs: (all APIs should be able to be found from the list of free APIs in resources tab of Slack posted by Joel)
* user inputs the name of an actor - chronological list of movies they played in is displayed
* user inputs desired year - top 5 movies or shows or both are displayed
* implement a quote from a movie/show

## To do: 
* rename gihub repo to something more creative?
* add all group members to github repo
* decide which CSS framework to use (NOT BOOTSTRAP) (some were listed in class--will re-listen to recording to find them)
* design general site layout to base the code structure off of
* begin coding!
